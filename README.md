Running the Project Locally
Since this is a static website, you can open index.html directly in a browser to view it. For a more reliable local setup, consider running a simple HTTP server:


Key API Endpoints:
GET /blog/posts/<name> - Retrieve posts list
GET /blog/posts/<name>/<id> - Retrieve a specific post by ID
POST /blog/posts/<name> - Create a new post
PUT /blog/posts/<name>/<id> - Update a post by ID
DELETE /blog/posts/<name>/<id> - Delete a post by ID
POST /auth/register - Register a new user
POST /auth/login - User login
Dependencies
This project uses no additional libraries or frameworks. Only vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are used.

Instructions for Developers
Editing Styles: All styling is contained in /css/main.css. Any new components or elements should follow the established styles or be added here.
JavaScript Functionality:
All interactive and API-related functions are located in the /js folder.
main.js handles UI functionality like form validations, animations, and event listeners.
api.js includes functions to interact with the API, making GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.
Testing:
Manually test each user story to ensure itâ€™s complete.

Deploy the application to a static hosting platform like GitHub .
Ensure that all required deliverables, including the GitHub repository, public demo link, Figma assets, and planning board, are accessible and up to date.
